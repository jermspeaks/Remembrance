Remembrance - DBC Final Project
========
###Update:
12/5/2014
Project is going open-source. If you want to help with the project, take some of the open issues and start working on it!

#Project Description:

Remembrance is an app for individuals who have lost a loved one. Users are able to create a remembrance page for their loved ones and can invite friends/family to view the page, write a loving memory, and upload photos.

For our project, we decided to write and implement a sentinent analysis algorithm mixed in with a state machine. This algorithm takes a user's input and gives it a corresponding score based on the content of their input. If the score falls below a certain threshold, our program automatically removes the post due to its negative nature.


##Technologies Used:

Ruby on Rails
PostgreSQL
Bootstrap
HTML5/CSS3
JavaScript(jQuery/AJAX)
RSpec/Jasmine
Git/Github
